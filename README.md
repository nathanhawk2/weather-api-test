## Description
This project was made to use an API and get weather for any searched city. Upon typing in any city and hitting the search button, the current weather and the next 5 day forecast is returned, giving you temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index, along with a photo to give you a brief description of the expected weather that day. You can also look up past searches by clicking a button.
